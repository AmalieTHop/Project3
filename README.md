# Project3


In the spring 2021, I took the course TMA4320 Introduction to Scientific Computation. The course consists of two equal parts: theoretical and practical/computational. The theoretical part of the course introduces the participants to numerical mathematics and prepares them for the scientific computing part. The latter consists of three compulsory projects originating from physics, biophysics and mathematics. All three project is done by me and another person, whose name is held confidential.

This is the third project, and it is closely related to mathematics. In this project we have studied certain characteristics of four numerical methods; Shampine-Bogackis method of order 3, Kuttas method of order 4, Kahans method of order 2 and Störmer-Verlets method of order 2. The characteristics we have studied is order of convergence, conservation of energy and Poincaré map. In all of the cases, we have used the Hénon–Heiles model as our problem. 

The file named Project1Description.pdf contains the description of the the project.

The file named Project1.ipynb is an excact copy of the submitted paper. All the results and plots are visible, so there is no need to run the code to read the project.
